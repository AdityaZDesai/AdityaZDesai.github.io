This is the front end of my custom website, which is made using ReactJS. I am hosting the React App using a free hosting service called Vercel.
The Backend of this website is coded using Express JS, with the Blogs and Login information being stored using MongoDB Atlas. The backend server is being run on an AWS EC2 instance,
where I'm using something called Caddy to have a virtual server which grants me a free SSL certificate allowing me to securely request info from my API app using https requests.
Here is the link: https://adityaz.vercel.app/
and here's some photos (I'll let you see the blogs yourself, for now only I can edit and post, but I will soon add a comments section):
